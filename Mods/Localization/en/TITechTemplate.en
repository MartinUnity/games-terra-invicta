TITechTemplate.description.ArmyNeuralInterface=Traditional command structures suffer from communication delays, hierarchical bottlenecks, and the inability to share experiential combat data in real-time. The Army Neural Interface eliminates these limitations by establishing a direct neural bridge between strategic commanders using bio-synthetic implants and quantum-encrypted thought transmission protocols. Each commander node contributes tactical awareness, battlefield intuition, and strategic analysis to the collective, creating an adaptive command intelligence that responds to threats with unprecedented coordination and speed.

TITechTemplate.displayName.JitterStreamParticleTechnology=Cyclical Jitter Protocols
TITechTemplate.summary.JitterStreamParticleTechnology=An improvised modification to standard particle accelerators. By bypassing the magnetic stabilization ring, the weapon produces a chaotic, wide-area 'spray' of charged particles. Extremely effective at saturation fire, though the emitter tends to glow white-hot after a single burst.
TITechTemplate.quote.JitterStreamParticleTechnology="The manual says the magnetic bottle needs to be 'stable' to prevent the beam from collapsing. I say stability is predictable! If *I* don't know where the particles are going, the Aliens definitely can't dodge 'em. We just... loosen the bolts on the focusing lens and let 'er rip. Just, uh, give it a minute to stop glowing before you fire again. We're running through a lot of gloves."

TITechTemplate.description.JitterStreamParticleTechnology=Standard particle weapons use heavy, expensive focusing lenses to keep the beam tight. We found that if you simply remove the stabilization dampeners entirely, the beam enters a self-sustaining wobble. This 'Jitter Stream' covers a wider area and bypasses point defenses by sheer volume of fire. Note: The 60-second cooldown is mandatory to allow the barrel to resolidify from a semi-liquid state.

TITechTemplate.summary.PlasmoidStreakerPrototype=A prototype weapon that generates a high-velocity stream of superheated plasma. By removing the magnetic stabilization, the plasma stream becomes erratic and covers a wider area, making it effective against point defenses. However, the weapon requires a cooldown period to allow the barrel to cool down and resolidify.
TITechTemplate.quote.PlasmoidStreakerPrototype="Heated plasmoid streams are great for melting through armor, but they can be easily dodged if the enemy knows where they're coming from. By removing the stabilization, we create a 'Jitter Stream' that sprays plasma in a wider area, making it much harder for enemies to evade. Just remember, after firing, give it a minute to cool down before you try to fire again. Safety first!"
